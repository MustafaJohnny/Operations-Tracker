## Overview
<<<<<<< HEAD

The Operations Tracker is a simple SPA App. This project will allow users to better track their expenditures and revenue, The Expense tracker will show you the homepage where you can see your balance, income, expenses, and the history of expenses, and you can also add or remove new transactions. I built this project on my own after only 4 months of starting my learning journey to become a Front-end developer.
